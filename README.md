## Social Links Profile Challenge
Welcome builder! ðŸ‘‹

Your challenge is to build out this social links profile component and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible. Give it your best shot!

## The Challenge
Your users should be able to:

View an interactive social links profile

See hover and focus states for all interactive elements

## Project Assets
You'll find everything you need in the /design and /assets folders:

Mobile and desktop design mockups (JPG format)

All required images (pre-optimized)

Font files (variable and static)

## Style guide with color palette and font specifications

Suggested Approach
Review the designs to plan your HTML structure and CSS strategy

Build the HTML content first

Style your project starting with base styles, then work section by section

Implement interactive states for all clickable elements

Feel free to use whatever tools and workflow you're most comfortable with. The important thing is to challenge yourself and create the best implementation you can!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
